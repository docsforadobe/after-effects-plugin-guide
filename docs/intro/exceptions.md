Exceptions
################################################################################

Handle all exceptions generated by your plug-in's code, *within* your plug-in. Pass those which didn't originate in your plug-in's code to After Effects.

After Effects' APIs are designed for plug-ins written in C, and don't expect exceptions. After Effects will crash immediately if one is thrown from within a plug-in.

The effect samples use a firewall around the switch statement in the ``main()`` function, and the AEGPs wrap their function hooks in try/catch blocks.
