Third-party Plug-in Hosts?
################################################################################

Some developers are wary of using each After Effects release's new API features, to maintain compatibility with hosts with partial implementations. You can distinguish between host applications by checking :ref:`effect-basics/PF_InData`>appl_id. After Effects uses the appl_id 'FXTC'.

Premiere Pro uses 'PrMr'. As of this writing, no third party hosts support SmartFX, or our AEGP functions. Also, see the chapter on compatibility with :ref:`ppro/ppro`.
