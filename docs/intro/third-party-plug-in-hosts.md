# Third-party Plug-in Hosts?

Some developers are wary of using each After Effects release’s new API features, to maintain compatibility with hosts with partial implementations. You can distinguish between host applications by checking [PF_InData](../effect-basics/PF_InData.md#effect-basics-pf-indata)>appl_id. After Effects uses the appl_id ‘FXTC’.

Premiere Pro uses ‘PrMr’. As of this writing, no third party hosts support SmartFX, or our AEGP functions.

Also, see the [Premiere Pro & Other Hosts](../ppro/ppro.md#ppro-ppro) section.
