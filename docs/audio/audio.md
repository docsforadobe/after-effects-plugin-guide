After Effects can process audio encoded at up to 96Khz, floating point (24-bit) resolution, mono or stereo.

We provide high quality resampling.

``PF_InData`` and ``PF_OutData`` both contain information specific to audio handling.

While audio isn't the focus of After Effects' feature set, it is an important component of compositing and pre-visualization workflows.

Also, several engineers on our team are audio fanatics, and ensure that our audio effects (and the whole audio pipeline) are of the highest quality.
