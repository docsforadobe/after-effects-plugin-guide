# PF_EventExtra

This structure provide context information for the current event. After Effects passes a pointer to this structure in the extra parameter of the [Entry Point](../effect-basics/entry-point.md) function.

The `PF_EventUnion` (sent in the `PF_EventExtra`) varies with the event type, and contains information specific to that event.

## PF_EffectWindowInfo

If an event occurs in the ECP, an PF_EffectWindowInfo is sent in PF_EventExtra.
