# Accessing Camera & Light Information

Using functions provided in the [AEGP_PFInterfaceSuite](../aegps/aegp-suites.md#aegps-aegp-suites-aegp-pfinterfacesuite), effects can access camera and lighting information for the layer to which theyâ€™re applied; see the Resizer sample.

You can also use many of the other functions from AE_GeneralPlug.h; the possibilities are vast.
