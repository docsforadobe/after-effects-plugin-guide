Plug-in Installation
################################################################################

Use the common plug-in folder as described `here <#where-installers-should-put-plug-ins>`__.

If you try to install an effect plug-in only to the Premiere Pro plug-ins directory, you will be surprised to find that your effect is not rendered when you export to disk through Adobe Media Encoder, an entirely separate application.

Oh, and you’ll also miss out on project interchange and copy / paste between Premiere Pro and After Effects.
