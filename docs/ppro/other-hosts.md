Other Hosts
################################################################################

For third-party hosts, the Adobe policy remains:

*"Adobe neither supports nor recommends the creation of Adobe-compatible third-party hosts. While it may be possible to create a partially functional host by reverse engineering from the plug-in API specification, we do not recommend it and will not support you in doing so."*

================================================================================

We realize that, for developers like you, one good way to grow your market is to ensure that your plug-ins work in as many hosts as possible.

Our SmartFX API has created quite a bit of distance between the After Effects API and the implementations available in the rest of the plug-in hosting world.

We will do what we can to help the other hosts support newer features. If you encounter problems in third party hosts, please refer them to us if they need assistance.
