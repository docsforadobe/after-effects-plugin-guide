# PF_InData

After Effects communicates system, project, layer and audio information using `PF_InData`. This structure is updated before each command selector is sent to a plug-in.

Fields valid only during specific [PF_Cmds](command-selectors.md) are noted.

Also, don't worry; although `PF_InData` is dauntingly large, you need not memorize each member's purpose; you'll use some of the fields some of the time.

## extent_hint Usage

!!! note
    Hint rectangles are much more effective...and complicated...for [SmartFX](../smartfx/smartfx.md).

Use `extent_hint` to process only those pixels for which output is required; this is one of the simplest optimizations you can make.

Tell After Effects you use `in_data>extent_hint` by setting [PF_OutFlag_USE_OUTPUT_EXTENT](PF_OutData.md#pf_outflags) in [PF_OutData](PF_OutData.md#pf_outdata) during [PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETUP](command-selectors.md#global-selectors) (and in your PiPL).

Disable caching from the preferences menu before testing `extent_hint` code, so After Effects renders your effect whenever anything in your composition changes.

Otherwise, the caching mechanism would obscure your plug-in's (possibly incorrect) output.

Move the layer within the composition so it's cropped. The `output>extent_hint` is the portion of the layer which is visible in the composition.

Add a mask to your layer and move it around.

This changes the `extent_hint`, which encloses all of the non-zero alpha areas of the image.

The `in_data>extent_hint` is the intersection of these two rectangles (the composition and the mask), and changes whenever they do.

Extent rectangles are computed in the coordinate space of the original input layer, before resizing and origin shifting, to simplify rectangle intersection between the input and output extents for effects which set [PF_OutFlag_PIX_INDEPENDENT](PF_OutData.md#pf_outflags).

To get the output extent in the coordinate system of the output buffer, offset the `extent_hint` by the `PF_InData->output_origin_x` and `y` fields.

Account for downsampling when computing output size; users must be able to render at full resolution.

If the output buffer exceeds 30,000 by 30,000, clamp it to that size, and consider displaying an alert dialog.

Once your code behaves correctly, enable the cache and see how frequently the effect needs to re-render.

Consider a drop shadow; users frequently apply a static drop shadow to a still image.

The `output>extent_hint` is ignored, so the cache is used more often.

For buffer-expanding effects, intersect the `output>extent_hint` with your plug-in's transformed bounds and sets the size accordingly during [PF_Cmd_FRAME_SETUP](command-selectors.md#frame-selectors).

---

## Now with 20% More Pixels!

As of 6.0, the extent_hints passed are 20% larger than the layer itself, to help with our predictive rendering decisions.

Numerous effects expand the buffer "just a touch", and After Effects often uses the hint rectangles later.

---

## Point Controls And Buffer Expansion

Effects which expand the output buffer position the original layer's upper left corner by setting set `output_origin_x/y` in `PF_InData` during [PF_Cmd_FRAME_SETUP](command-selectors.md#frame-selectors).

This shift is reported to subsequent effects in the `pre_effect_source_origin_x/y`. Point parameters are adjusted for this shift automatically.

Apply a buffer expander such as Gaussian Blur or the Resizer SDK sample, *before* your effect, and use a large resize value.

If your effect is not handling `pre_effect_source_origin_x/y` correctly, turning the blur on and off will shift the position of the output.

All point parameter values (at any time) have shift values described by `pre_effect_source_origin_x/y`. For most effects this works transparently.

However, if a buffer expansion changes over time (as with an animated blur amount), the origin shift will move non-animated points.

Consider this when designing effects which cache point parameter values between frames.
