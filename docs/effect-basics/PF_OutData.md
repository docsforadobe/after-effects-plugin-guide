## PF_OutFlags

These flags communicate capability and status information to After Effects. In previous versions they were also used to send rudimentary messages, e.g. refresh the UI, send an error message.

These capabilities have been supplanted by function suites, and all new messaging functions will come in that format. However, capability flags are still contained in the [PiPL](../intro/pipl-resources.md#intro-pipl-resources).

Update both the PiPL and your source code when you make a change. Many of these flags can be changed during an After Effects session.

## PF_OutFlags2

We added a second set of outflags in After Effects 5.0; partly for room to expand in the future, and partly to break ourselves of the bad habit of repurposing existing flags.

As with `PF_OutFlags`, many of these flags can be changed during an After Effects session.

And don’t forget to update both the [PiPL](../intro/pipl-resources.md#intro-pipl-resources) and your source code when you make a change.

| `PF_OutFlag2_OUTPUT_IS_WATERMARKED`                      | New in CS6. Set this during [PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETUP](command-selectors.md#effect-basics-command-selectors-global-selectors) if your output is going to be watermarked in some way that makes it unsuitable for final use, probably because the user is using an unlicensed demo version.<br/><br/>It is ok to change this state during the course of app session during [PF_Cmd_QUERY_DYNAMIC_FLAGS](command-selectors.md#effect-basics-command-selectors-messaging), if e.g. a floating license status changes.<br/><br/>Plug-in authors that actually do have this state changing asynchronously must be careful to have the next render match the last state returned from [PF_Cmd_QUERY_DYNAMIC_FLAGS](command-selectors.md#effect-basics-command-selectors-messaging) otherwise race conditions could cause incorrect frames to be cached.<br/><br/>(This is a non-issue if you only change this in response to `DO_DIALOG`.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `PF_OutFlag2_SUPPORTS_GPU_RENDER_F32`                    | New in 16.0 Set during PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETUP, this indicates GPU support.<br/><br/>The effect will be called with GPU selectors, and will be badged as GPU-supporting in the GUI.<br/><br/>At `PF_Cmd_GPU_DEVICE_SETUP` time, these flags indicate rendering capabilities for a specific device and framework.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
